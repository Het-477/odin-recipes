    <h2>Description:- </h2>
    <p>Baigan bharta, also spelled baingan bharta or baigan chokha (mashed eggplant) is an Indian dish prepared by
        mashing or mincing grilled eggplant (baigan) with tomato, onion, herbs and spices, with variations being common
        from chef to chef.[b] Traditionally, cooking the eggplants over charcoals, inside of a tandoor, barbecue grill
        or oven, or even directly applying flame to the outside of the fruit infuses the dish with a smoky flavour; the
        blackened skin is then easily peeled and the eggplant may be further prepared.</p>

    <p>Baigan bharta is most often grilled, minced eggplant stewed with chopped tomato, browned onion or shallots,
        ginger, garlic, cumin, and topped with lime or lemon juice, fresh cilantro (coriander leaves) and sliced fresh
        green chili pepper. Depending on region and personal tastes, ghee (clarified butter) may be used in preparation
        of the dish. In some regions where mustard oil is popular, this may be used, though it possesses a powerful
        flavour and aroma. Most chefs use a neutral, high-smoking-point vegetable oil like canola or sunflower oil.[3]
        Traditionally, the dish is eaten by hand with flatbread (specifically roti, naan or paratha), and can also be
        served with a variety of rice dishes, like biryani, khichdi or pulao. The meal will usually be rounded-out with
        various pickles (mango, lime, lemon, etc) as well as raita, a palate-cooling yogurt dish/condiment (similar to
        Greek tzatziki) with many forms, including mint, mango or cucumber preparations. In Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, it
        is served hot with litti or baati</p>

    <p> In India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, baigan bharta is part of the most popular cuisine items. In India, it is
        found in various regional styles, with ingredients varying from one region to another. Some chefs and recipes
        utilise seasonal mashed pumpkin, squash or sweet potato for added thickness and flavour. The dish has since
        spread to areas outside of India, particularly countries with high numbers of Indians and their descendants,
        including the United Kingdom, Australia, and parts of the United States and Canada. It is popularly eaten in the
        Caribbean, in places like Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago, where it is known as baigan chokha</p>
