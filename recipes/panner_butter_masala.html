    <h1>Discreption:- </h1>

    <p>This Paneer Butter Masala recipe is a rich and creamy dish of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) in a tomato, butter
        and cashew sauce that is known here as “makhani gravy.” The acidity of the tomatoes and the sweetness of the
        cream make for a velvety, nearly addictive sauce.
        <br>
        Also known as “Butter Paneer,” this yummy and popular vegetarian dish is derived from the recipe for Butter
        Chicken, a.k.a. Chicken Makhani, that I learned to make during my cooking school days. I know, I know, the
        thought of me cooking with meat sounds insane. It seems nearly a lifetime ago!
        <br>
        With my easy, quick and delicious recipe you can prepare this Restaurant style Paneer Butter Masala at home. In
        fact, it's so easy that you can make it on even busy weeknights! This simple dinner takes just 10 minutes of
        prep work and 30 minutes on the stove.
